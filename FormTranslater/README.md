# FormTranslater

I had worked for Imex System INC, we had a project what provides a tool to migrate existing Oracle Forms and Reports applications to Java/ADF (JSF extension), but we did not completely finish.

I thought this is a very interesting idea, so I redesigned the entire architecture. For the respect of copyright, I did not adopt the ADF architecture, but chose GWT.

This is a story of ten years ago, I almost give up, if anyone is willing to invest in this project, then I can start over and rebuild a pure web application based on Angular or React.

This project can show my skill on Java UI, Multi-Thread and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
