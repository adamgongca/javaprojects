# AVLTree
This is a Java implementation of an AVL tree data stucture that stores nodes that contain integer values. 

About AVL Tree, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

This project is based on my friend's assignment, I felt it is interested, so I implemented the functions what are defined in his assignment.
